Histograms are the most common method for visualizing the distribution of a variable. A simple histogram can be very useful to get a first glance at the data. However, compared to other prominent plot types like pie-, bar-, or line plots, they are rather boring to look at. Most importantly, they require a statistical background to be interpreted correctly. However, before we ditch the histogram entirely, let’s try and make it more beautiful, richer in information, as well as easier to interpret!
In this tutorial, we’ll take a standard matplotlib histogram and improve it aesthetically as well as add some useful components. For this, we’ll follow a three-step-procedure, as layed out in my article “From Data Analyst to Data Storyteller”:
1. Add Information
2. Remove Information
3. Emphasize Information
