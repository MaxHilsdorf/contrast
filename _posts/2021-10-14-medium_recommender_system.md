While music genre plays an enormous role in building and displaying social identity, the emotional expression of a song and — even more importantly — its emotional impression on the listener is often underestimated in the domain of music preferences.

This has changed dramatically with the availability of custom or pre-curated playlists and personal recommendations on digital music platforms.
