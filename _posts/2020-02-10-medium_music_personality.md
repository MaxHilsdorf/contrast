With the technological achievements of the 21st century, our favorite music is now available to listen to at any time on our mobile devices. MP3 and music streaming have enabled music listening to manifest itself in about every facet of everyday life. For a long time, research on the functions of music was built on the sociological axiom that music listening is inherently social. However, recent research consistently objects, suggesting that everyday music consumption is rather a deeply personal and self-referential matter.

Take Spotify as an example. In 2010, Spotify jumped onto the social train and started a cooperation with Facebook. Users were now able to create personal profiles, add friends and share their music with everyone everywhere. Today, these features have entirely disappeared and made place for personal recommendations and context related workout or study playlists. In line with recent studies, Spotify users were not interested much in music as a social good and preferred to keep it personal.

There has been a fair bit of research on individual differences in the ways people listen to music. In this article, I will give you insights into this research field. You will learn what the Big-Five personality traits are, and how they can help you understand what you, your friends, or your customers are really looking for in the music they choose to listen to.
