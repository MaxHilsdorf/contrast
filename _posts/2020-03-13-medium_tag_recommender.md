I was listening to a podcast about AI in the music industry, recently. When we think of AI and music, it’s typically music classification and generation that come to mind first. In this podcast, however, Alex Jacobi from “With Love and Data” blew my mind with a completely different approach. With his team, he developed a ML model that let’s media producers find the right music for their ads, movies, etc. much more efficiently. When they search for a few keywords, the model will also recommend them music that is not tagged with any of the keywords, but with keywords somehow related to those they searched for. This is genius!

Imagine how many opportunities you have missed, looking up the ‘wrong’ keywords searching for books, academic literature, programming tutorials, or cat videos. I find it stunning. If we look at it this way, tags are a means of communication between vendors and demanders in a platform setting. If we want to buy new socks on amazon, the searching process is rather straighfoward, because we can verbally describe our object of interest. In the case of music, however, we need to rely on title and tags to describe the product we look for or offer in a somewhat decent way. Therefore, the improtance of good tagging, and that is effective tagging that brings vendors and demanders together, cannot be stressed enough! There’s only two ways to improve searching for content with tags.
* Find ways to work around bad tagging
* Find ways to use better tags
