Are you a music lover or a programmer? Chances are, you’re both, just like me! When I started using Spotipy, I had little programming experience and wanted to explore computational audio analysis. Now, as I’m knee-deep into programming and Data Science, I’m starting to appreciate Spotipy for creating amazing datasets for my data science projects.
This library is great for you if
* you are a data scientist or programmer wanting to generate interesting datasets for machine learning
* you are a musician/musicologist wanting to learn programming or data analysis

Spotipy is a Python library that makes it easier for users to access the Spotify Web API and retrieve all kinds of music data from it. When I started using Spotipy, it was the first time I ever got in touch with an API. Therefore, if you have never used API’s, don’t worry. You can do it!
You can do these things with Spotipy:
1. Work with your own user data (create or edit your playlists, find your favorite tracks etc.)
1. Get data for every track, album, and artist on Spotify
In this guide, we’ll explore the possibilities of the latter application. I’m going to show you how to use this data to create amazing datasets for statistical analyses or machine learning projects.
