Cronbach’s Alpha is the dominant measure of scale reliability in psychology and the social sciences. Its importance can’t be overstated and you’ll find it in almost every quantitative empirical study you’ll read. Surprisingly, there hasn’t been a single article published on Medium covering its application in Python. On top, none of the common data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, or Sklearn feature Cronbach alpha measures. This article will show you exactly how to do it.
First, I’ll explain some of the theory and math behind Cronbach's alpha. Then, we’ll quickly get to hands-on coding.
