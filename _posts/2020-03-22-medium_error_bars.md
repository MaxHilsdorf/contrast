In scientific studies, displaying error bars in your descriptive visualizations is inevitable. Holding information about the variability of your data, they are a necessary complement to your mean scores. However, scientific visualizations tend to be more beautiful on the inside than on the outside.
As data scientists, we are taught to use attractive visualizations to tell stories. Anything that distracts the viewer from the main point we are trying to make is adviced to be removed. This makes perfect sense, as managers and customers usually neither have a good grasp of statistics nor much time and energy to spend on your visualizations.
To interpret error bars, you need:
* a basic understanding of descriptive statistics
* information on what kind of error bar is displayed (typically standard deviation or standard error)

Both of those presuppositions conflict with the aim of a data storyteller. You want anyone to understand the results without having to read through eight lines of notes.
Data storytellers see error bars as obstacles, because they prevent easy, comfortable, and uniform interpretation of their data. Scientists, on the other hand, are trained to display all necessary information and let the reader interpret the results on their own. Neither of these approaches is superior. Oversimplifying results in technical reports or data team meetings is just as disadvantageous as annoying your managers and customers with spontaneous lectures in statistics.
