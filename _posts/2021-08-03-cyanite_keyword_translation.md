[Cyanite](https://cyanite.ai/) has expanded their keyword analysis tools and now offers a multitude of unique and innovative AI-driven products. Some of these products, for all of which I was a major contributor, are: \
__Keyword Cleaning__ \
Cyanite identifies tagging mistakes in their customers' catalogues. Non-fitting keywords (e.g. "sad" alongside "happy" and "cheerful") are flagged and redundant keywords (e.g. "aggressive" and "aggression") are identified. \
__Keyword Translation__ \
Using its deep knowledge of which keywords are used in which contexts, Cyanite is able to merge two or more keyword catalogues into one, even with widely different keyword taxonomies.
