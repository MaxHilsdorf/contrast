There are plenty of things to learn in the field of data science. Typically, as a Data Scientist, you tend to learn as you go. If your current task requires new methods, you do some research until you can solve the problem at hand. However, applications of graph theory often hide where we do not expect them if we have not learned the fundamentals of this discipline. In this post, I will show you how, for certain applications, the very basics of graph theory can

* speed up your code dramatically
* reduce functions with plenty of looping, indexing, etc. to sweet one-liners
* make certain tasks possible which were previously practically unsolvable
All concepts learned will be very basic and accompanied by images or code. Plus, I will not introduce more than 5 new terms.
