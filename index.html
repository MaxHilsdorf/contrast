title: "About Me"
---

I am a __musicologist__ and __data science student__ with experience working as a student research assistant in academia and as a data scientist in the industry. <br>

Heading to university to study musicology and become a composer, my professional ambitions could not have made a sharper turn. What started with an obligatory
seminar on quantitative research methods soon got me started absorbing statistics books and learning to code in Python. <br>

In academia, I worked as a research assistant at Justus-Liebig-University (Giessen, GER), analyzing and visualizing data as
well as co-authoring multiple scientific publications in the field of music psychology. <br>

As a Data Scientist, I currently work at [Cyanite](https://cyanite.ai/), developing solutions for a wide range of music companies, focusing on NLP and audio-based deep learning. <br>

On [Medium](https://medium.com/@maxhilsdorf), I have published over a dozen articles in the domains of data science and musicology, accumulating to over 250,000 views.
