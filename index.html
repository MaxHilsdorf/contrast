I am a Data Scientist and Musicologist with experience working as a Student Research Assistant in academia
and as a Data Scientist in the industry. My main field of expertise is Music Information Retrieval, but I also have experience in Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, and Natural Language Processing.
Artificial Intelligence, to me, is the primary accelator as well as the main threat for human progress. Best make it work!

<b>A Quick Tour Through My Professional Background</b> <br> <br>

In academia, I worked as a <b>Student Research Assistant</b> at Justus-Liebig-University (Giessen, GER), analyzing and visualizing data as
well as co-authoring multiple scientific publications in the field of music psychology. <br> <br>

My <b>bachelor's thesis</b> in musicology on the interaction of personality, uses of music, and the acceptance of music streaming services
was published in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.659062/full">Frontiers in Psychology</a>. <br> <br>

In my <b>data science studies</b>, I developed a data processing pipeline that automates all pre-machine-learning steps for a wide range of audio classification tasks.
This pipeline will be published on GitHub soon. <br> <br>

As a <b>Data Scientist</b>, I currently work at <a href="https://cyanite.ai/">Cyanite</a>, developing AI solutions for
a wide range of music companies, focusing on audio-based deep learning and NLP. <br> <br>

On <a href="https://medium.com/@maxhilsdorf">Medium</a>, I have published over a dozen articles in the domains of data science and musicology, accumulating to over 300,000 views. <br> <br>
