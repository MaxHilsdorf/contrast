title: "About Me"
---

I am a musicologist and data science student with experience working as a student research assistant in academia and as a data scientist in the industry.

Heading to university to study musicology and become a composer, my professional ambitions could not have made a sharper turn. What started with an obligatory seminar on quantitative research methods soon got me started absorbing statistics books and learning to code in Python.

In academia, I worked as a research assistant at Justus-Liebig-University (Giessen, GER), analyzing and visualizing data as well as co-authoring multiple scientific publications in the field of music psychology.

As a Data Scientists, I currently work at Cyanite, developing solutions for a wide range of music companies, focusing on NLP and audio-based deep learning.

On Medium, I have published over a dozen articles in the domains of data science and musicology, accumulating to over 250,000 views.
